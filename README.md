BeefyText
=========

A [Chrome extension][1] to fatten up skinny text.

Are you tired of tiny, thin, gray text on websites that's virtually unreadable? BeefyText lets you set a minimum (or maximum) font weight and size for the page you are viewing, and lets you override the color of the text on the page.

In Version 1.0, changes are reset whenever the page is refreshed, but a later version will allow saving per-site settings.
